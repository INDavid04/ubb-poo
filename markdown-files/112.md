## Explanation

### Concepts Used

1. [[Class and Object concepts]]: The code defines a class `cls` with a private data member `x` and a public constructor. An object of this class is created in the `main` function.
2. [[Encapsulation]]: The data member `x` is private, meaning it can only be accessed within the class itself.
3. [[Constructors]]: The class `cls` has a constructor that initializes the private data member `x`.
4. [[Operator Overloading]]: The code attempts to overload the `*` operator, but it does so incorrectly.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Class and Object Concepts 🧐
The class `cls` is defined with a single private data member `x`. The constructor `cls(int y)` initializes `x` with the value of `y`. In the `main` function, two objects `m` and `n` of type `cls` are created with initial values 100 and 15, respectively.

#### Encapsulation 🔒
The data member `x` is private, which means it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This is a good practice as it encapsulates the data and prevents unauthorized access.

#### Constructors 🏗️
The constructor `cls(int y)` is used to initialize the object's state. When `cls m(100)` is called, the constructor sets `m.x` to 100.

#### Operator Overloading ⚙️
The code attempts to overload the `*` operator to multiply two `cls` objects. However, the operator overloading is incorrect. In C++, when you overload a binary operator like `*`, it should take only one argument, not two. The correct way to overload the `*` operator is as follows:

```cpp
int operator*(const cls& b) const { return (this->x * b.x); }
```

Here, `this` refers to the current object, and `b` is the object being multiplied with the current object.

### Corrected Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class cls {
    int x;

public:
    cls(int y) { x = y; }
    int operator*(const cls& b) const { return (this->x * b.x); }
};

int main()
{
    cls m(100), n(15);
    cout << m * n;  // Output will be 1500
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Corrected Code
- The `operator*` function now takes only one argument, which is the object to be multiplied with the current object.
- The `const` keyword ensures that the function does not modify the current object or the passed object.
- The `this` pointer is used to access the current object's data member `x`.

### Output of Corrected Code
```
1500
```

### Additional Concepts

#### [[Const-correctness & code clarity]] 🧹
The use of `const` in the corrected code ensures that the objects being operated on are not modified, which improves code clarity and safety.

#### [[Exception-safe design]] 🛡️
Although not directly related to this example, ensuring that operator overloading and other functions are exception-safe is crucial in robust C++ programming.

### Simpler Example to Illustrate Operator Overloading
Consider a simpler example where we overload the `+` operator for a class `Point`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Point {
    int x, y;

public:
    Point(int a, int b) : x(a), y(b) {}
    Point operator+(const Point& p) const {
        return Point(x + p.x, y + p.y);
    }
    void print() const {
        cout << "(" << x << ", " << y << ")" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Point p1(1, 2), p2(3, 4);
    Point p3 = p1 + p2;
    p3.print();  // Output will be (4, 6)
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `+` operator is overloaded to add two `Point` objects, resulting in a new `Point` object whose `x` and `y` are the sums of the corresponding coordinates of the two points.

### Conclusion
The original code had a compilation error due to incorrect operator overloading. By understanding [[Operator Overloading]] and [[Const-correctness & code clarity]], we corrected the code to properly multiply two objects of the class `cls`. This example also highlights the importance of [[Class and Object concepts]] and [[Encapsulation]] in C++ programming.

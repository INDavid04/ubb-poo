## Code Explanation

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** 🧱
   - The code defines two classes: `B` and `D`.
   - `B` is the base class, and `D` is the derived class that inherits from `B`.
   - Objects of these classes are created in the `main()` function.

### 2. **Encapsulation** 🔒
   - The data members `x` (static) and `i` are declared as `protected` in class `B`. This means they are accessible within the class and its derived classes but not outside.
   - Methods like `get_x()` and `get_i()` are public, providing controlled access to the data members.

### 3. **Inheritance** 🧬
   - Class `D` inherits from class `B` using the syntax `class D : public B`. This means `D` has access to the `protected` and `public` members of `B`.

### 4. **Static Data Members** 📊
   - `x` is a static data member of class `B`. It is shared across all instances of `B` and its derived classes.
   - The line `int B::x;` initializes the static variable `x` outside the class definition.

### 5. **Constructors and Destructors** 🏗️
   - **Constructor**: The constructor of `B` increments the static variable `x` and initializes `i` to 1.
   - **Destructor**: The destructor of `B` decrements the static variable `x`.
   - Class `D` also has a constructor and destructor that modify `x`.

### 6. **Memory Management** 🧠
   - The `new` and `delete` operators are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
   - `B* p = new B[10];` allocates an array of 10 `B` objects.
   - `delete[] p;` deallocates the array.
   - `p = new D;` allocates a single `D` object, and `delete p;` deallocates it.

### 7. **Polymorphism** 🎭
   - The function `f(B* q)` accepts a pointer to a `B` object. This allows it to work with both `B` and `D` objects, demonstrating polymorphism.

### 8. **Static Methods** ⚙️
   - `get_x()` is a static method in class `B`. It can be called without an object instance, e.g., `D::get_x()`.

## Simpler Example to Explain [[Static Data Members]]

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
public:
    static int count; // Static data member
    Counter() { count++; } // Constructor increments count
    ~Counter() { count--; } // Destructor decrements count
};

int Counter::count = 0; // Initialize static member

int main() {
    Counter c1;
    cout << "Count: " << Counter::count << endl; // Output: 1
    {
        Counter c2;
        cout << "Count: " << Counter::count << endl; // Output: 2
    }
    cout << "Count: " << Counter::count << endl; // Output: 1
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `count` is a static data member shared across all instances of `Counter`.
- The constructor increments `count`, and the destructor decrements it.
- The output shows how `count` changes as objects are created and destroyed.

## Key Takeaways
- The code demonstrates [[Inheritance]] and [[Polymorphism]] through the relationship between `B` and `D`.
- [[Static Data Members]] and [[Static Methods]] are used to maintain shared state across instances.
- [[Memory Management]] is handled using `new` and `delete`.
- The use of [[Constructors]] and [[Destructors]] ensures proper initialization and cleanup of resources.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class cls
{ 
    int x;
public: 
    cls(int y) { x = y; }
    friend int operator*(cls a, cls b) { return (a.x * b.x); } 
};

int main()
{ 
    cls m(100), n(15);
    cout << m * n;
    return 0; 
}
```

## Output
```
1500
```

## Explanation of the Code ðŸ§ 

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines a class `cls` with a private data member `x` and a public constructor.
   - Objects `m` and `n` of the class `cls` are created in the `main()` function.
   - The class encapsulates the data member `x` and provides a way to initialize it using a constructor.

### 2. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - The data member `x` is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This is an example of [[Encapsulation]], where data is hidden and accessed only through methods or functions.

### 3. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - The class `cls` has a constructor `cls(int y)` that initializes the private data member `x` with the value passed as an argument.
   - In `main()`, the objects `m` and `n` are initialized with values `100` and `15`, respectively.

### 4. **Operator Overloading** [[Operator Overloading]]
   - The `operator*` function is defined as a friend function inside the class `cls`. It overloads the `*` operator to multiply the `x` values of two `cls` objects.
   - When `m * n` is called in `main()`, the overloaded `operator*` function is invoked, which returns the product of `m.x` and `n.x` (i.e., `100 * 15 = 1500`).

## Key Concepts Used ðŸ”‘

1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]: The code defines a class `cls` and creates objects `m` and `n` from it.
2. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]: The private data member `x` is hidden and accessed only through the constructor and the overloaded operator.
3. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]: The constructor initializes the object's state.
4. **Operator Overloading** [[Operator Overloading]]: The `*` operator is overloaded to perform multiplication on objects of the class.

## Simpler Example to Understand Operator Overloading ðŸŽ¯

Hereâ€™s a simpler example to understand [[Operator Overloading]]:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Number {
    int value;
public:
    Number(int v) : value(v) {}
    int operator+(Number n) {
        return value + n.value;
    }
};

int main() {
    Number a(5), b(10);
    cout << a + b; // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```

- In this example, the `+` operator is overloaded to add two `Number` objects. When `a + b` is called, it returns the sum of their `value` members.

## Why This Code is Important? ðŸŒŸ

- This code demonstrates how [[Operator Overloading]] can be used to define custom behavior for operators when working with user-defined types (like classes).
- It also shows the importance of [[Encapsulation]] in protecting data members and providing controlled access to them.

---

## Whatâ€™s Missing? ðŸ¤”

- The code does not use [[Destructors]], [[Inheritance]], [[Polymorphism]], or other advanced concepts like [[Memory Management]] or [[Exceptions]].
- It also doesnâ€™t involve [[Templates & Generic Programming]] or [[Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ ðŸš€]].

## Final Thoughts ðŸ’¡

This is a simple yet powerful example of how [[Operator Overloading]] and [[Encapsulation]] can be used in C++ to create intuitive and reusable code. Itâ€™s a great starting point for understanding how C++ allows you to define custom behaviors for operators and manage data effectively! ðŸš€

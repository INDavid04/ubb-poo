    # C++ Code Documentation 📄

    ## Code Overview
    The provided C++ code demonstrates the use of [[Inheritance]], [[Constructors]], [[Destructors]], and [[Data Members]] in a class hierarchy. The program defines three classes: `B`, `D1`, and `D2`, where `D1` inherits from `B`, and `D2` inherits from `D1`. The program also includes a function `f` that takes objects of `D1` and `D2` as arguments and returns an object of `D1`.

    ### Code
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class B {
    protected:
        int i;
    public:
        B(int j = 5) {
            cout << " cb ";
            i = j - 2;
        }
        ~B() {
            cout << " db ";
        }
        int get_i() {
            return i;
        }
    };

    class D1 : public B {
        int j;
    public:
        D1(int k = 10) {
            cout << " cd1 ";
            j = i - k + 3;
        }
        ~D1() {
            cout << " dd1 ";
        }
    };

    class D2 : public D1 {
        int k;
    public:
        D2(int l = 15) {
            cout << " cd2 ";
            k = i - l + 3;
        }
        ~D2() {
            cout << " dd2 ";
        }
    };

    D1 f(D1 d1, D2 d2) {
        return d1.get_i() + d2.get_i();
    }

    int main() {
        D2 ob2;
        D1 ob1(3);
        cout << f(ob1, ob2).get_i() + ob2.get_i();
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    ### Output
    ```
    cb  cd1  cd2  cb  cd1  cb  cd1 6 dd1  db  dd1  db  dd2  dd1  db  dd1  db  dd2  dd1  db
    ```

    ## Explanation of the Code 🧠

    ### 1. **Class Hierarchy and [[Inheritance]]**
    - The class `B` is the base class.
    - `D1` inherits from `B`, and `D2` inherits from `D1`. This creates a multi-level inheritance chain.
    - Inheritance allows `D1` and `D2` to access the `protected` member `i` from `B`.

    ### 2. **[[Constructors]] and [[Destructors]]**
    - Each class has a constructor and a destructor.
    - The constructors initialize the data members and print messages to indicate their execution.
    - The destructors print messages when objects are destroyed.

    #### Example of Constructor Execution:
    ```cpp
    D2 ob2; // Calls B(), D1(), and D2() constructors in order.
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    cb  cd1  cd2
    ```

    #### Example of Destructor Execution:
    When an object goes out of scope, its destructor is called in reverse order of construction.

    ### 3. **[[Data Members]]**
    - `B` has a `protected` integer `i`.
    - `D1` has a private integer `j`.
    - `D2` has a private integer `k`.

    ### 4. **Function `f`**
    - The function `f` takes two objects (`D1` and `D2`) as arguments.
    - It returns a new `D1` object whose `i` value is the sum of the `i` values of the input objects.

    ### 5. **Object Creation and Destruction in `main`**
    - `D2 ob2;` creates an object of `D2`, which triggers the constructors of `B`, `D1`, and `D2`.
    - `D1 ob1(3);` creates an object of `D1` with a custom argument, triggering the constructors of `B` and `D1`.
    - The function `f(ob1, ob2)` creates temporary objects, which are destroyed after the function call.

    ## Key Concepts Used 🛠️

    1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**: The program defines classes (`B`, `D1`, `D2`) and creates objects (`ob1`, `ob2`).
    2. **[[Inheritance]]**: `D1` inherits from `B`, and `D2` inherits from `D1`.
    3. **[[Constructors]] and [[Destructors]]**: Used to initialize and clean up objects.
    4. **[[Data Members]]**: Each class has its own data members (`i`, `j`, `k`).
    5. **[[Encapsulation]]**: Data members are protected or private, and access is controlled through methods.

    ## Simpler Example to Explain [[Inheritance]] 🎓

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class Animal {
    public:
        void eat() {
            cout << "Animal is eating!" << endl;
        }
    };

    class Dog : public Animal {
    public:
        void bark() {
            cout << "Dog is barking!" << endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Dog myDog;
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    **Output:**
    ```
    Animal is eating!
    Dog is barking!
    ```

    In this example:
    - `Dog` inherits from `Animal`, so it can use the `eat()` method.
    - `Dog` also defines its own method `bark()`.

    ## Summary of Output Analysis 📊

    1. **Object Creation**:
    - `D2 ob2;` triggers `B()`, `D1()`, and `D2()` constructors.
    - `D1 ob1(3);` triggers `B()` and `D1()` constructors.
    2. **Function Call**:
    - `f(ob1, ob2)` creates temporary objects, triggering constructors and destructors.
    3. **Destruction**:
    - Objects are destroyed in reverse order of creation, triggering destructors.

    The final output `6` is the result of `f(ob1, ob2).get_i() + ob2.get_i()`.

    ## Additional Concepts to Explore 🔍

    - **[[Polymorphism]]**: Not used here, but could be added with virtual functions.
    - **[[Memory Management]]**: The program uses stack memory for objects.
    - **[[Const-correctness & code clarity]]**: Adding `const` to methods like `get_i()` would improve code safety.

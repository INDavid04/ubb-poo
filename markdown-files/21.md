## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    int x;
    A(int i = -13) { x = i; }
};

class B : virtual public A {
public:
    B(int i = -15) { x = i; }
};

class C : virtual public A {
public:
    C(int i = -17) { x = i; }
};

class D : virtual public A {
public:
    D(int i = -29) { x = i; }
};

class E : public B, public D, public C {
public:
    int y;
    E(int i, int j)
        : D(i)
        , B(j)
    {
        y = x + i + j;
    }
    E(E& ob) { y = ob.x - ob.y; }
};

int main()
{
    E e1(5, 10), e2 = e1;
    cout << e2.y;
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

## Explanation 🧠

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines several classes (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`) and creates objects of these classes.
   - For example, `E e1(5, 10)` creates an object `e1` of class `E`.

---

### 2. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - The classes `B`, `C`, and `D` inherit from class `A` using **virtual inheritance**. This ensures that only one instance of `A` is shared among `B`, `C`, and `D` in the hierarchy.
   - Class `E` inherits from `B`, `D`, and `C` using **multiple inheritance** [[Multiple Inheritance]].

---

### 3. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - Each class has a constructor that initializes its `x` member variable.
   - For example, `A(int i = -13)` initializes `x` to `-13` if no argument is provided.
   - The `E` class has two constructors:
     - A parameterized constructor: `E(int i, int j)` initializes `y` based on `x`, `i`, and `j`.
     - A copy constructor: `E(E& ob)` initializes `y` as `ob.x - ob.y`.

---

### 4. **Virtual Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - Virtual inheritance is used to prevent multiple instances of the base class `A` when `E` inherits from `B`, `C`, and `D`.
   - Without `virtual`, `E` would have three separate instances of `A` (one from each parent class).

---

### 5. **Data Members** [[Data Members]]
   - Each class has a data member `x`, and class `E` has an additional data member `y`.
   - The `x` member is inherited from `A` and shared among `B`, `C`, and `D` due to virtual inheritance.

---

### 6. **Copy Constructor** [[Constructors]]
   - The `E` class has a copy constructor: `E(E& ob)`. It is used to initialize `e2` from `e1` in `main()`.
   - The copy constructor calculates `y` as `ob.x - ob.y`.

---

### 7. **Output Explanation**
   - When `E e1(5, 10)` is called:
     - `D(i)` initializes `x` to `5` (from `D`'s constructor).
     - `B(j)` initializes `x` to `10` (from `B`'s constructor).
     - Since `A` is shared, the last initialization (`B(j)`) sets `x` to `10`.
     - `y` is calculated as `x + i + j = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25`.
   - When `e2 = e1` is called:
     - The copy constructor is invoked, and `y` is calculated as `ob.x - ob.y = 10 - 25 = -15`.
   - Hence, the output is `-15`.

## Simpler Example for Virtual Inheritance 🎯

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    int x;
    Base(int i = 0) : x(i) {}
};

class Derived1 : virtual public Base {
public:
    Derived1(int i) : Base(i) {}
};

class Derived2 : virtual public Base {
public:
    Derived2(int i) : Base(i) {}
};

class Final : public Derived1, public Derived2 {
public:
    Final(int i, int j) : Derived1(i), Derived2(j) {}
};

int main() {
    Final obj(5, 10);
    cout << obj.x; // Output: 10 (last initialization wins)
    return 0;
}
```

- Here, `Final` inherits from `Derived1` and `Derived2`, which both inherit virtually from `Base`.
- Only one instance of `Base` is shared, and `x` is initialized to `10` (from `Derived2`).

## Key Takeaways 🚀
- Virtual inheritance prevents duplication of the base class in multiple inheritance scenarios.
- Constructors and copy constructors play a crucial role in object initialization.
- Understanding how data members are shared and initialized is essential in complex class hierarchies.

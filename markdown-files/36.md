## Explanation 🧐

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines a class `cls` with a private data member `x` and public member functions.
   - The class has a constructor that initializes `x` with a given integer value.
   - The class also has methods `set_x` and `get_x` to modify and retrieve the value of `x`, respectively.

### 2. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - The data member `x` is private, meaning it can only be accessed or modified through the public methods `set_x` and `get_x`. This is a classic example of encapsulation, where the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world.

### 3. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - The class `cls` has a parameterized constructor `cls(int i)` that initializes the data member `x` with the value of `i`.
   - The error in the code occurs because the class does not have a default constructor (a constructor with no parameters). When you try to create an array of `cls` objects using `new cls[10]`, the compiler tries to call the default constructor for each object in the array, but it doesn't exist.

### 4. **Memory Management** [[Memory Management]]
   - The code uses dynamic memory allocation with `new` to create an array of `cls` objects. However, this leads to a compilation error due to the absence of a default constructor.

### 5. **Error Analysis**
   - The compilation error occurs because the class `cls` does not have a default constructor. When you allocate an array of objects using `new cls[10]`, the compiler needs to call the default constructor for each object in the array. Since the class only has a parameterized constructor, the compiler cannot find a matching constructor to call.

### 6. **Fixing the Code**
   - To fix the code, you can either:
     - Add a default constructor to the class `cls`.
     - Use a different approach to allocate and initialize the array of objects.

#### Example Fix:
```cpp
class cls {
    int x;

public:
    cls(int i = 0) { x = i; } // Default constructor with a default argument
    int set_x(int i)
    {
        int y = x;
        x = i;
        return y;
    }
    int get_x() { return x; }
};
```

### 7. **Simpler Example to Illustrate Constructors**
```cpp
class MyClass {
    int value;
public:
    MyClass(int v = 0) : value(v) {} // Default constructor with a default argument
    int getValue() { return value; }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj; // Uses the default constructor
    cout << obj.getValue(); // Outputs 0
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the class `MyClass` has a default constructor that initializes `value` to 0 if no argument is provided. This allows the creation of objects without explicitly passing an argument.

### 8. **Conclusion**
- The code demonstrates the importance of having a default constructor when dynamically allocating arrays of objects. Without it, the compiler cannot initialize the objects, leading to a compilation error.
- The concepts of [[Class and Object concepts]], [[Encapsulation]], [[Constructors]], and [[Memory Management]] are crucial in understanding and fixing the code.

### 9. **Additional Concepts**
- **Const-correctness & code clarity** [[Const-correctness & code clarity]]: Ensuring that methods that do not modify the state of the object are marked as `const` can improve code clarity and safety.
- **Exception-safe design** [[Exception-safe design]]: When dealing with dynamic memory allocation, it's important to ensure that resources are properly managed, especially in the presence of exceptions.

### 10. **Final Thoughts**
- The code is a good example of how object-oriented principles like encapsulation and constructors are applied in C++. However, it also highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of memory management and constructor usage in C++.

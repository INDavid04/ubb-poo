# C++ Code Documentation 📄

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
protected:
    int x;

public:
    A(int i = 14) { x = i; }
};

class B : A {
public:
    B()
        : A(2)
    {
    }
    B(B& b) { x = b.x - 14; }
    void afisare() { cout << x; }
};

int main()
{
    B b1, b2(b1);
    b2.afisare();
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
-12
```

## Explanation of the Code 🧠

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines two classes: `A` and `B`.
   - `A` is the base class, and `B` is the derived class.
   - Objects `b1` and `b2` are created from class `B` in the `main()` function.

### 2. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - Class `B` inherits from class `A`. This is an example of **single inheritance**.
   - The `protected` member `x` from class `A` is accessible in class `B` because `B` inherits from `A`.

### 3. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - **Default Constructor in `A`**: The constructor `A(int i = 14)` initializes `x` to `14` if no argument is passed. This is a **default argument**.
   - **Constructor in `B`**: 
     - `B()` calls the constructor of `A` with the value `2`, so `x` is initialized to `2`.
     - `B(B& b)` is a **copy constructor** that initializes `x` to `b.x - 14`.

### 4. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - The member `x` in class `A` is declared as `protected`, meaning it is accessible only within the class and its derived classes. This is an example of **encapsulation**.

### 5. **Data Members** [[Data Members]]
   - `x` is a **data member** of class `A`. It holds an integer value and is inherited by class `B`.

### 6. **Copy Constructor** [[Constructors]]
   - The copy constructor `B(B& b)` is used to create a new object `b2` from `b1`. It modifies the value of `x` by subtracting `14` from `b1.x`.
   - Since `b1.x` is `2` (set by the default constructor of `B`), `b2.x` becomes `2 - 14 = -12`.

### 7. **Output Explanation**
   - The `afisare()` method in class `B` prints the value of `x`.
   - When `b2.afisare()` is called, it prints `-12`.

## Concepts Used in the Code 🛠️

1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - Classes `A` and `B` are defined, and objects `b1` and `b2` are created.

2. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - Class `B` inherits from class `A`.

3. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - The `protected` access specifier ensures that `x` is only accessible within `A` and its derived classes.

4. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - Default constructor in `A` and parameterized/copy constructors in `B`.

5. **Data Members** [[Data Members]]
   - `x` is a data member of class `A`.

## Simpler Example to Understand Inheritance and Constructors 🎓

### Example: Inheritance and Constructors
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Parent {
protected:
    int value;
public:
    Parent(int v = 10) : value(v) {}
    void show() { cout << "Value: " << value << endl; }
};

class Child : public Parent {
public:
    Child(int v = 20) : Parent(v) {}
};

int main() {
    Child c;
    c.show(); // Output: Value: 20
    return 0;
}
```
- Here, `Child` inherits from `Parent`.
- The constructor of `Child` calls the constructor of `Parent` with a value, initializing `value` to `20`.

---

## Key Takeaways 🚀
- **Inheritance** allows a class to reuse code from another class.
- **Constructors** initialize objects, and **copy constructors** create new objects from existing ones.
- **Encapsulation** ensures data is protected and only accessible in a controlled manner.

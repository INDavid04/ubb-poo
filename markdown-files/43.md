# C++ Code Documentation 📄

## Code
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class cls {
    int x; // [[Data Members]]
public:
    cls(int i=0) { cout << " c1 "; x = i; } // [[Constructors]]
    ~cls() { cout << " d1 "; } // [[Destructors]]
};

class cls1 {
    int x; cls xx; // [[Data Members]] and [[Class and Object concepts]]
public:
    cls1(int i=0) { cout << " c2 "; x = i; } // [[Constructors]]
    ~cls1() { cout << " d2 "; } // [[Destructors]]
} c; // Global object of cls1

class cls2 {
    int x; cls1 xx; cls xxx; // [[Data Members]] and [[Class and Object concepts]]
public:
    cls2(int i=0) { cout << " c3 "; x = i; } // [[Constructors]]
    ~cls2() { cout << " d3 "; } // [[Destructors]]
};

int main() {
    cls2 s; // Local object of cls2
    return 0;
}
// Output: c1 c2 c1 c2 c1 c3 d3 d1 d2 d1 d2 d1
```

## Explanation 🧠

### Key Concepts Used:
1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**: 
   - The code defines three classes: `cls`, `cls1`, and `cls2`. These classes are used to create objects.
   - For example, `cls2 s;` creates an object `s` of type `cls2`.

2. **[[Data Members]]**:
   - Each class contains private data members (`int x`) and objects of other classes (`cls xx`, `cls1 xx`, etc.).
   - These data members are initialized when an object is created.

3. **[[Constructors]]**:
   - Each class has a constructor that initializes its data members and prints a message.
   - For example, `cls(int i=0)` is the constructor for `cls`, which prints `c1`.

4. **[[Destructors]]**:
   - Each class has a destructor that prints a message when the object is destroyed.
   - For example, `~cls()` is the destructor for `cls`, which prints `d1`.

5. **[[Encapsulation]]**:
   - The data members (`int x`) are private, meaning they can only be accessed within the class. This is an example of encapsulation.

### How the Code Works 🔍

1. **Global Object `c`**:
   - The global object `c` of type `cls1` is created before `main()` is executed.
   - This triggers the constructor of `cls1`, which prints `c2`.
   - Since `cls1` contains an object of `cls` (`cls xx`), the constructor of `cls` is also called, printing `c1`.

2. **Local Object `s`**:
   - In `main()`, the local object `s` of type `cls2` is created.
   - This triggers the constructor of `cls2`, which prints `c3`.
   - Since `cls2` contains objects of `cls1` (`cls1 xx`) and `cls` (`cls xxx`), their constructors are also called, printing `c2` and `c1` respectively.

3. **Destruction Order**:
   - When `main()` ends, the local object `s` goes out of scope.
   - The destructor of `cls2` is called first, printing `d3`.
   - Then, the destructors of the contained objects (`cls1 xx` and `cls xxx`) are called, printing `d2` and `d1` respectively.
   - Finally, the global object `c` is destroyed, calling its destructor and printing `d2` and `d1`.

### Simplified Example for [[Constructors]] and [[Destructors]] 🛠️

Here’s a simpler example to understand constructors and destructors:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Simple {
public:
    Simple() { cout << "Constructor called!\n"; }
    ~Simple() { cout << "Destructor called!\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Simple obj; // Constructor is called here
    return 0;   // Destructor is called here when obj goes out of scope
}
```

**Output:**
```
Constructor called!
Destructor called!
```

### Key Takeaways 🎯

- **[[Constructors]]** are called when an object is created.
- **[[Destructors]]** are called when an object is destroyed (e.g., goes out of scope).
- The order of constructor and destructor calls depends on the object's lifetime and scope.
- **[[Encapsulation]]** ensures that data members are protected from external access.

This code is a great example of how [[Class and Object concepts]], [[Constructors]], [[Destructors]], and [[Encapsulation]] work together in C++! 🚀

# C++ Code Documentation 📄

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
protected:
    int x;

public:
    A(int i = 14) { x = i; }
};

class B : A {
public:
    B()
        : A(2)
    {
    }
    B(B& b) { x = b.x - 14; }
    void afisare() { cout << x; }
};

int main()
{
    B b1, b2(b1);
    b2.afisare();
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
-12

## Explanation 🧠

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines two classes: `A` and `B`.
   - `A` is a base class with a protected data member `x` and a constructor.
   - `B` is a derived class that inherits from `A`. It has its own constructors and a method `afisare()` to display the value of `x`.

### 2. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - Class `B` inherits from class `A`. This means `B` has access to the protected members of `A` (like `x`).
   - Inheritance is demonstrated here by the `: A(2)` syntax in the constructor of `B`, which initializes the base class `A` with a value of `2`.

### 3. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - The data member `x` in class `A` is marked as `protected`, meaning it can be accessed by derived classes (like `B`) but not by external code.
   - This is an example of encapsulation, where data is hidden from outside access.

### 4. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - Class `A` has a constructor that initializes `x` with a default value of `14` if no argument is provided.
   - Class `B` has two constructors:
     - A default constructor that initializes `A` with `2`.
     - A copy constructor that takes a `B` object and sets `x` to `b.x - 14`.

### 5. **Data Members** [[Data Members]]
   - The `x` variable in class `A` is a data member. It holds the state of the object.
   - In class `B`, `x` is inherited from `A` and can be accessed directly.

### 6. **Copy Constructor** [[Constructors]]
   - The copy constructor in `B` modifies the value of `x` by subtracting `14` from the `x` of the passed object.
   - This is why `b2` ends up with `x = -12` when `b1` has `x = 2`.

---

## Code Execution Flow 🔄

1. **Object Creation**:
   - `B b1` creates an object `b1` using the default constructor of `B`. This sets `x` to `2` (since `A(2)` is called).
   - `B b2(b1)` creates an object `b2` using the copy constructor of `B`. This sets `x` to `b1.x - 14`, which is `2 - 14 = -12`.

2. **Method Call**:
   - `b2.afisare()` prints the value of `x` in `b2`, which is `-12`.

---

## Key Concepts Used 🛠️

- [[Class and Object concepts]]: Classes `A` and `B` are defined, and objects `b1` and `b2` are created.
- [[Inheritance]]: Class `B` inherits from class `A`.
- [[Encapsulation]]: The `x` variable is protected and accessible only within the class hierarchy.
- [[Constructors]]: Both default and copy constructors are used.
- [[Data Members]]: The `x` variable holds the state of the objects.

## Simpler Example to Explain Copy Constructor 📝

Here’s a simpler example to explain the concept of a copy constructor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
public:
    int value;

    Example(int v = 0) : value(v) {} // Default constructor
    Example(Example& e) { value = e.value + 5; } // Copy constructor
};

int main() {
    Example e1(10); // e1.value = 10
    Example e2(e1);  // e2.value = 10 + 5 = 15
    cout << e2.value; // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The copy constructor modifies the value by adding `5` to the original object's value.
- This is similar to how the copy constructor in class `B` modifies `x` by subtracting `14`.

## Summary 📌

This code demonstrates [[Inheritance]], [[Encapsulation]], and [[Constructors]] in C++. The output `-12` is a result of the copy constructor in class `B` modifying the inherited `x` value. 🎉

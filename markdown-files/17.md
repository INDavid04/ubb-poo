# C++ Code Documentation

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
protected:
    static int x;

public:
    A(int i = 0) { x = i; }
    virtual A schimb() { return (7 - x); }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B(int i = 0) { x = i; }
    void afisare() { cout << x; }
};

int A::x = 5;

int main() {
    A* p1 = new B(18);
    *p1 = p1->schimb();
    ((B*)p1)->afisare();
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
-11

## Code Explanation

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** 🧩
   - The code defines two classes: `A` and `B`. 
   - `A` is the base class, and `B` is the derived class that inherits from `A`.
   - An object of type `B` is created dynamically using `new B(18)`.

### 2. **Static Data Members** 📊
   - The variable `x` in class `A` is declared as `static`. This means it is shared across all instances of the class.
   - `int A::x = 5;` initializes the static member `x` to 5.

### 3. **Inheritance** 🧬
   - Class `B` inherits from class `A` using `public A`. This means `B` has access to the `protected` and `public` members of `A`.
   - The `x` variable is inherited by `B` from `A`.

### 4. **Polymorphism** 🎭
   - The `schimb()` function in class `A` is declared as `virtual`, allowing it to be overridden in derived classes. However, in this case, `B` does not override it.
   - The line `*p1 = p1->schimb();` calls the `schimb()` function from class `A` because `B` does not override it.

### 5. **Constructors** 🏗️
   - Both classes `A` and `B` have constructors that initialize the static member `x`.
   - The constructor of `A` is called first when an object of `B` is created, followed by the constructor of `B`.

### 6. **Memory Management** 💾
   - The object `p1` is dynamically allocated using `new B(18)`. This allocates memory on the heap.
   - However, the code does not explicitly delete the allocated memory, which could lead to a memory leak.

### 7. **Casting** 🔄
   - The line `((B*)p1)->afisare();` uses a C-style cast to cast the pointer `p1` (of type `A*`) to `B*`. This allows calling the `afisare()` function, which is specific to class `B`.

## Key Concepts Used

1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**: The code defines classes `A` and `B` and creates an object of type `B`.
2. **[[Inheritance]]**: Class `B` inherits from class `A`.
3. **[[Polymorphism]]**: The `schimb()` function is declared as `virtual` in class `A`.
4. **[[Static Data Members]]**: The variable `x` is shared across all instances of class `A` and its derived classes.
5. **[[Constructors]]**: Both classes have constructors that initialize the static member `x`.
6. **[[Memory Management]]**: The object `p1` is dynamically allocated using `new`.
7. **[[Casting]]**: A C-style cast is used to call a function specific to class `B`.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Static Member `x`
- The static member `x` is initialized to 5 outside the class definition.
- When `new B(18)` is called, the constructor of `B` sets `x` to 18.
- The `schimb()` function in class `A` returns an object of type `A` with `x` set to `7 - x`. Since `x` is 18, `7 - 18 = -11`.
- The assignment `*p1 = p1->schimb();` updates the object pointed to by `p1` with the result of `schimb()`, which sets `x` to -11.
- Finally, `afisare()` prints the value of `x`, which is now -11.

### Simpler Example: Static Members
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    static int count;
    MyClass() { count++; }
};

int MyClass::count = 0;

int main() {
    MyClass obj1, obj2;
    cout << "Total objects: " << MyClass::count; // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```
- Here, `count` is a static member shared across all instances of `MyClass`.

## Conclusion
This code demonstrates the use of [[static data members]], [[inheritance]], [[polymorphism]], and [[casting]] in C++. The static member `x` is shared across all instances of class `A` and its derived class `B`, and its value is modified through the `schimb()` function. The final output is `-11`, which is the result of the calculation `7 - 18`.

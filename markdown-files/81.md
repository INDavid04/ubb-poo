## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class B {
public:
    int x;
    B(int i = 16) { x = i; }
    B f(B ob) { return x + ob.x; }
};
class D : public B {
public:
    D(int i = 25) { x = i; }
    B f(B ob) { return x + ob.x + 1; }
    void afisare() { cout << x; }
};
int main()
{
    B *p1 = new D, *p2 = new B, *p3 = new B(p1->f(*p2));
    cout << p3->x;
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
41

## Explanation üß†

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines two classes: `B` (base class) and `D` (derived class).
   - Objects of these classes are created in the `main()` function using dynamic memory allocation (`new`).

   Example:
   ```cpp
   B *p1 = new D; // p1 is a pointer to an object of class D
   ```

---

### 2. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - Class `D` inherits from class `B`. This means `D` has access to the `public` members of `B`.
   - The `x` variable and the `f()` function from `B` are accessible in `D`.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   class D : public B { ... }; // D inherits from B
   ```

---

### 3. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - Both classes `B` and `D` have constructors.
   - The constructor of `B` initializes `x` to a default value of `16` if no argument is provided.
   - The constructor of `D` initializes `x` to a default value of `25`.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   B(int i = 16) { x = i; } // Constructor of B
   D(int i = 25) { x = i; } // Constructor of D
   ```

---

### 4. **Polymorphism** [[Polymorphism]]
   - The function `f()` is overridden in class `D`. This is an example of **function overriding**, a form of polymorphism.
   - However, **dynamic polymorphism** (using `virtual` functions) is not used here, so the function called depends on the pointer type, not the object type.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   B *p1 = new D; // p1 is a pointer of type B but points to an object of type D
   p1->f(*p2);    // Calls B::f(), not D::f(), because f() is not virtual
   ```

---

### 5. **Memory Management** [[Memory Management]]
   - The code uses `new` to dynamically allocate memory for objects.
   - However, it does not use `delete` to free the memory, which can lead to **memory leaks**.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   B *p1 = new D; // Allocates memory for a D object
   // Missing delete p1;
   ```

---

### 6. **Data Members** [[Data Members]]
   - Both classes have a public data member `x`.
   - This is generally not recommended due to **encapsulation** concerns [[Encapsulation]].

   Example:
   ```cpp
   int x; // Public data member
   ```

---

### 7. **Function Overriding**
   - The `f()` function in class `D` overrides the `f()` function in class `B`.
   - However, since `f()` is not declared as `virtual`, the function called depends on the pointer type, not the object type.

   Example:
   ```cpp
   B f(B ob) { return x + ob.x + 1; } // Overrides B::f()
   ```

---

### 8. **Output Explanation**
   - `p1` points to an object of type `D` with `x = 25`.
   - `p2` points to an object of type `B` with `x = 16`.
   - `p1->f(*p2)` calls `B::f()` (not `D::f()` because `f()` is not `virtual`), so it returns `25 + 16 = 41`.
   - `p3` is a pointer to a new `B` object initialized with `41`.
   - The output is `41`.

---

## Simpler Example to Illustrate Polymorphism üéØ

Here‚Äôs a simpler example to explain **polymorphism** using `virtual` functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() { cout << "Animal sound\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override { cout << "Woof!\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Animal *a = new Dog;
    a->speak(); // Outputs "Woof!" because speak() is virtual
    delete a;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Woof!
```

In this example, `speak()` is declared as `virtual`, so the function called depends on the object type, not the pointer type.

## Summary of Concepts Used üîç
1. [[Class and Object concepts]]
2. [[Inheritance]]
3. [[Constructors]]
4. [[Polymorphism]] (function overriding, but not dynamic polymorphism)
5. [[Memory Management]] (dynamic allocation, but no deallocation)
6. [[Data Members]] (public data members)
7. [[Encapsulation]] (not fully followed due to public data members)

---

## Key Takeaways üöÄ
- Always use `virtual` for functions if you want **dynamic polymorphism**.
- Follow **encapsulation** by making data members `private` or `protected`.
- Always pair `new` with `delete` to avoid memory leaks.
- Use **constructors** to initialize objects properly.

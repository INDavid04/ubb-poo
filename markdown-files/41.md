## Code
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int f(int y)
{
    if(y < 0) throw y;  // Throws an exception if y is negative
    return y / 2;       // Returns half of y
}

int main()
{
    int x;
    try
    {
        cout << "Da-mi un numar par: ";  // Prompts the user for an even number
        cin >> x;                        // Reads the input from the user
        if(x % 3)                        // Checks if x is not divisible by 3
            x = f(x);                    // Calls function f if x is not divisible by 3
        else 
            throw x;                      // Throws an exception if x is divisible by 3
        cout << "Numarul " << x << " e bun!\n";  // Outputs that the number is good
    }
    catch(int i)
    {
        cout << "Numarul " << i << " nu e bun!\n";  // Outputs that the number is not good
    }

## Explanation

### Overview
This C++ program demonstrates the use of [[Exceptions]] to handle specific conditions in the input provided by the user. The program asks the user for an even number and then processes it based on certain conditions.

### Key Concepts Used

1. **[[Exceptions]]**: 
   - The program uses exceptions to handle two specific cases:
     - If the input number is negative, the function `f(int y)` throws an exception.
     - If the input number is divisible by 3, the `main()` function throws an exception.
   - The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the `catch` block handles the exception by printing a message.

2. **[[Function]]**:
   - The function `f(int y)` is defined to take an integer `y` and return `y / 2`. However, if `y` is negative, it throws an exception.

3. **[[Input/Output]]**:
   - The program uses `cin` to take input from the user and `cout` to display output messages.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Function `f(int y)`**:
  - This function checks if the input `y` is negative. If it is, it throws `y` as an exception.
  - If `y` is not negative, it returns `y / 2`.

- **`main()` Function**:
  - The program starts by prompting the user to input an even number.
  - It then checks if the number is divisible by 3:
    - If it is not divisible by 3, it calls the function `f(x)` and assigns the result to `x`.
    - If it is divisible by 3, it throws `x` as an exception.
  - If no exception is thrown, it prints that the number is good.
  - If an exception is caught, it prints that the number is not good.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Input: 4**
   - 4 is not divisible by 3, so `f(4)` is called.
   - `f(4)` returns 2.
   - Output: `Numarul 2 e bun!`

2. **Input: 6**
   - 6 is divisible by 3, so an exception is thrown.
   - Output: `Numarul 6 nu e bun!`

3. **Input: -5**
   - -5 is negative, so `f(-5)` throws an exception.
   - Output: `Numarul -5 nu e bun!`

### Simpler Example to Illustrate [[Exceptions]]

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int age;
        cout << "Enter your age: ";
        cin >> age;
        if (age < 0) {
            throw "Age cannot be negative!";
        }
        cout << "Your age is: " << age << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Error: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This simpler example asks the user for their age.
  - If the age is negative, it throws an exception with a message.
  - The `catch` block catches the exception and prints the error message.

### Conclusion
This program is a good example of how to use [[Exceptions]] to handle specific conditions in your code. It also demonstrates basic [[Input/Output]] and [[Function]] usage in C++. The use of exceptions allows the program to handle unexpected or invalid input gracefully, providing a clear message to the user.

🚀 **Pro Tip**: Always use exceptions to handle error conditions that are outside the normal flow of your program. This makes your code more robust and easier to debug! 🐛

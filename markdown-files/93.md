#include <typeinfo>
using namespace std;

class A
{
	int i;
public: A() { i = 1; }
		int get_i() { return i; }
};
class B: public A
{
	int j;
public: B() { j = 2; }
		int get_j() { return j; }
};

{
	A *p;
	int x = 0;
	if (x) p = new A;
	else p = new B;
	if (typeid(p).name() == typeid(B*).name()) cout << ((B*)p)->get_j();
	else cout << "tipuri diferite";
	return 0;

## Explanation of the Code 🧠

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines two classes: `A` and `B`.
   - `A` is the base class, and `B` is the derived class (inherits from `A`).
   - Objects of these classes can be created to store data and perform operations.

### 2. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - Both classes `A` and `B` use encapsulation to hide their internal data members (`i` and `j`) from direct access.
   - Instead, they provide public methods (`get_i()` and `get_j()`) to access these private members.

### 3. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - Class `B` inherits from class `A`. This means `B` has access to the public and protected members of `A`.
   - For example, `B` can use the `get_i()` method from `A`.

### 4. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - Both classes have constructors:
     - `A()` initializes `i` to `1`.
     - `B()` initializes `j` to `2` and implicitly calls `A()` to initialize `i`.

### 5. **Memory Management** [[Memory Management]]
   - The code uses `new` to dynamically allocate memory for objects of type `A` or `B`.
   - However, the code does not free this memory using `delete`, which could lead to memory leaks. 🚨

### 6. **Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)** [[Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) in C++ �]]
   - The `typeid` operator is used to check the type of the pointer `p` at runtime.
   - The expression `typeid(p).name() == typeid(B*).name()` checks if `p` points to an object of type `B`.
   - Since `p` is declared as `A*`, even though it points to a `B` object, `typeid(p)` will return `A*`. This is why the output is `"tipuri diferite"`.

## Key Concepts Used in the Code 🔑

1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]:
   - Classes (`A` and `B`) are blueprints for creating objects.
   - Objects are instances of these classes.

2. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]:
   - Data members (`i` and `j`) are private and accessed via public methods.

3. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]:
   - `B` inherits from `A`, allowing it to reuse `A`'s functionality.

4. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]:
   - Used to initialize objects when they are created.

5. **Memory Management** [[Memory Management]]:
   - Dynamic memory allocation using `new`.

6. **Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)** [[Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) in C++ �]]:
   - Used to determine the type of an object at runtime.

## Simplified Example for RTTI 🧩

Here’s a simpler example to understand RTTI:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>
using namespace std;

class Animal {};
class Dog : public Animal {};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    if (typeid(*a) == typeid(Dog)) {
        cout << "It's a Dog!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "It's not a Dog!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
It's a Dog!
```

In this example:
- `typeid(*a)` checks the actual type of the object `a` points to (which is `Dog`).
- This is different from the original code, where `typeid(p)` checks the type of the pointer itself (`A*`).

## Missing Concepts in the Code �

1. **Polymorphism** [[Polymorphism]]:
   - The code does not use polymorphism. For example, it could have used virtual functions to allow dynamic binding.

2. **Destructors** [[Destructors]]:
   - No destructors are defined, and memory is not freed, which is bad practice.

3. **Const-correctness & Code Clarity** [[Const-correctness & code clarity]]:
   - The code could benefit from `const` correctness, e.g., marking `get_i()` and `get_j()` as `const` methods.

4. **Exception-safe Design** [[Exception-safe design]]:
   - The code does not handle exceptions, which could occur during memory allocation.

## Final Thoughts 💡

This code demonstrates basic [[Class and Object concepts]], [[Inheritance]], and [[Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) in C++ 🧐]]. However, it lacks proper [[Memory Management]], [[Polymorphism]], and [[Exception-safe design]]. Adding these concepts would make the code more robust and efficient. 🚀

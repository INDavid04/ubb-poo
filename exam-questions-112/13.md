## Code Overview

The provided C++ code demonstrates the use of [[Exceptions]] and function overloading. The program asks the user for an even number and processes it using different functions based on whether the number is even or odd. If the number is odd, it throws an exception, which is then caught and handled in the `main` function.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to handle integer input
int f(int y)
{
    try {
        if (y > 0)
            throw y;  // Throws the value of y if it is positive
    }
    catch (int i) {
        throw;  // Re-throws the caught exception
    }
    return y - 2;  // Returns y - 2 if no exception is thrown
}

// Overloaded function to handle two integer inputs
int f(int y, int z)
{
    try {
        if (y < z)
            throw z - y;  // Throws the difference between z and y if y < z
    }
    catch (int i) {
        throw;  // Re-throws the caught exception
    }
    return y + 2;  // Returns y + 2 if no exception is thrown
}

// Function to handle float input by reference
float f(float& y)
{
    cout << " y este referinta";  // Prints a message indicating y is a reference
    return (float)y / 2;  // Returns half of y
}

int main()
{
    int x;
    try {
        cout << "Da-mi un numar par: ";  // Asks the user for an even number
        cin >> x;
        if (x % 2)
            x = f(x, 0);  // Calls the overloaded function if x is odd
        else
            x = f(x);  // Calls the original function if x is even
        cout << "Numarul " << x << " e bun!" << endl;  // Prints the result
    }
    catch (int i) {
        cout << "Numarul " << i << " nu e bun!" << endl;  // Handles the exception
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
Executable not found after successful compilation.

## Concepts Used ðŸ§ 

1. **[[Exceptions]]**: The code uses exceptions to handle errors. When a condition is met (e.g., `y > 0` or `y < z`), an exception is thrown and caught in the `catch` block. The exception is then re-thrown to be handled in the `main` function.

2. **Function Overloading**: The code defines multiple functions with the same name (`f`) but different parameter lists. This is an example of [[Polymorphism]] at compile time.

3. **[[Data Members]]**: Although not explicitly used in this code, the concept of data members is fundamental in C++ for storing state within objects.

4. **[[Const-correctness & code clarity]]**: The code could benefit from const-correctness, especially in the function `float f(float& y)`, where the parameter could be marked as `const` if it is not modified.

5. **[[Exception-safe design]]**: The code demonstrates basic exception handling, ensuring that exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.

## Simplified Example to Illustrate [[Exceptions]]

Hereâ€™s a simpler example to illustrate how exceptions work in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int age;
        cout << "Enter your age: ";
        cin >> age;
        if (age < 18) {
            throw "You must be at least 18 years old!";
        }
        cout << "Access granted - you are old enough." << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Error: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
Enter your age: 16
Error: You must be at least 18 years old!
```

In this example, if the user enters an age less than 18, an exception is thrown, and the program catches it, printing an error message.

## Conclusion

The provided C++ code is a good example of using [[Exceptions]] and [[Polymorphism]] through function overloading. It demonstrates how to handle errors and process different types of input using the same function name but different parameter lists. The code could be improved by incorporating [[Const-correctness & code clarity]] and ensuring [[Exception-safe design]] principles are fully applied.

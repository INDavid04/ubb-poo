#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class cls1 {
protected:
    int x;
public:
    cls1(int i = 10) { x = i; }
    int get_x() { return x; }
};

class cls2 : cls1 {
public:
    cls2(int i) : cls1(i) {}
};

int main() {
    cls2 d(37);
    cout << d.get_x();
    return 0;
}

## Explanation

### Concepts Used

1. **[Class and Object concepts]**: The code defines two classes, `cls1` and `cls2`. `cls1` is a base class with a protected data member `x` and a public method `get_x()`. `cls2` is a derived class that inherits from `cls1`.

2. **[Inheritance]**: `cls2` inherits from `cls1`. However, the inheritance is private by default because no access specifier is provided. This means that all members of `cls1` (including `get_x()`) are private in `cls2`.

3. **[Encapsulation]**: The data member `x` in `cls1` is protected, which means it can be accessed by derived classes but not by objects of the base class or derived class directly.

4. **[Constructors]**: Both `cls1` and `cls2` have constructors. `cls1` has a default constructor with a default argument, and `cls2` has a constructor that initializes `cls1` with a given value.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Private Inheritance**: In C++, when you inherit a class without specifying an access specifier, it defaults to private inheritance. This means that all public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class. In this case, `cls2` privately inherits from `cls1`, making `get_x()` a private member of `cls2`. Therefore, when you try to call `d.get_x()` in `main()`, it results in a compilation error because `get_x()` is inaccessible.

- **Access Specifiers**: The `protected` keyword in `cls1` ensures that `x` is accessible within `cls1` and its derived classes but not from outside. However, due to private inheritance, even the protected members become private in the derived class.

### Fixing the Code

To fix the code, you need to change the inheritance to public:

```cpp
class cls2 : public cls1 {
public:
    cls2(int i) : cls1(i) {}
};
```

With this change, `get_x()` will be public in `cls2`, and the code will compile and run correctly, outputting `37`.

### Simpler Example

Consider this simpler example to understand private inheritance:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    void show() { cout << "Base show" << endl; }
};

class Derived : Base { // Private inheritance by default
public:
    void display() { show(); } // Accessing Base's show() within Derived
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.display(); // Works fine
    // d.show(); // Error: 'show' is inaccessible
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `show()` is accessible within `Derived` but not from outside `Derived` due to private inheritance.

### Conclusion

The original code demonstrates the importance of understanding [[Inheritance]] and [[Access Specifiers]] in C++. By default, inheritance is private, which can lead to accessibility issues if not handled properly. Changing the inheritance to public resolves the issue, allowing the derived class to access the base class's public members.

## Explanation

### Concepts Used

1. **[Class and Object concepts]**: The code defines a class `cls` with a static data member `x` and member functions. An object `ob` of this class is created in the `main` function.

2. **[Encapsulation]**: The class `cls` encapsulates its data member `x` and member functions, making `x` private and the member functions public.

3. **[Data Members]**: The class has a static data member `x`, which is shared across all instances of the class.

4. **[Constructors]**: The class has a constructor that initializes the static data member `x`. The constructor has a default argument, making it a default constructor as well.

5. **[Static Members]**: The data member `x` and the member function `g()` are declared as static. Static members belong to the class rather than any object instance.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Static Data Member
- The static data member `x` is initialized to `7` outside the class definition:
  ```cpp
  int cls::x = 7;
  ```
- This means that `x` is shared among all instances of the class `cls`.

#### Constructor
- The constructor of `cls` initializes the static data member `x`:
  ```cpp
  cls(int i = 1) { x = i; }
  ```
- The constructor has a default argument, so it can be called without any arguments, initializing `x` to `1`.

#### Member Function `f`
- The member function `f` takes an object of type `cls` as an argument and returns the sum of the static data member `x` and the `x` of the passed object:
  ```cpp
  cls f(cls a) { return x + a.x; }
  ```
- This function is non-static, meaning it can only be called on an instance of the class.

#### Static Member Function `g`
- The static member function `g` attempts to call the non-static member function `f` without an object:
  ```cpp
  static int g() { return f() / 2; }
  ```
- This is the source of the compilation error. Static member functions cannot call non-static member functions directly because they do not have access to an instance of the class.

### Compilation Error
- The error occurs because the static member function `g` tries to call the non-static member function `f` without an object:
  ```cpp
  static int g() { return f() / 2; }
  ```
- The compiler expects `f` to be called on an instance of `cls`, but since `g` is static, it doesn't have access to any instance.

### Fixing the Code
To fix the code, you need to create an instance of `cls` within the static member function `g` and then call `f` on that instance:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class cls {
    static int x;

public:
    cls(int i = 1) { x = i; }
    cls f(cls a) { return x + a.x; }
    static int g() { 
        cls temp;  // Create an instance of cls
        return temp.f(temp) / 2;  // Call f on the instance
    }
};
int cls::x = 7;
int main()
{
    cls ob;
    cout << cls::g();
    return 0;
}
```

### Simpler Example to Illustrate Static vs Non-Static Members

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
public:
    static int staticVar;
    int nonStaticVar;

    Example(int val) : nonStaticVar(val) {}

    static void staticFunc() {
        cout << "Static Var: " << staticVar << endl;
        // cout << nonStaticVar;  // Error: cannot access non-static member
    }

    void nonStaticFunc() {
        cout << "Non-Static Var: " << nonStaticVar << endl;
        cout << "Static Var: " << staticVar << endl;
    }
};

int Example::staticVar = 10;

int main() {
    Example obj(5);
    Example::staticFunc();  // Call static function
    obj.nonStaticFunc();    // Call non-static function
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- `staticVar` is a static data member shared across all instances.
- `nonStaticVar` is a non-static data member unique to each instance.
- `staticFunc` can only access static members.
- `nonStaticFunc` can access both static and non-static members.

This illustrates the difference between static and non-static members and how they can be accessed. 🧐

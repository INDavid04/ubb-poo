# C++ Code Documentation

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class B {
    int x;

public:
    B(int i = 17) { x = i; }
    int get_x() { return x; }
    operator int() { return x; }
};

class D : public B {
public:
    D(int i = -16)
        : B(i)
    {
    }
};

int main()
{
    D a;
    cout << 27 + a;
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```

## Explanation of the Code

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** 🧩
- The code defines two classes: `B` and `D`.
- `B` is the base class, and `D` is the derived class that inherits from `B`.
- An object `a` of type `D` is created in the `main()` function.

### 2. **Encapsulation** 🔒
- The data member `x` in class `B` is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This is an example of [[Encapsulation]].
- Access to `x` is provided through the public method `get_x()`.

### 3. **Inheritance** 🧬
- Class `D` inherits from class `B` using the `public` keyword. This is an example of [[Inheritance]].
- The constructor of `D` initializes the base class `B` using the member initializer list `: B(i)`.

### 4. **Constructors** 🏗️
- Class `B` has a constructor that takes an integer parameter `i` with a default value of `17`. This is an example of a [[Constructor]].
- Class `D` also has a constructor with a default value of `-16`, which passes this value to the constructor of `B`.

### 5. **Operator Overloading** ⚙️
- Class `B` overloads the `int` type conversion operator (`operator int()`). This allows an object of type `B` (or `D`, since `D` inherits from `B`) to be implicitly converted to an `int`. This is an example of [[Operator Overloading]].
- In the expression `27 + a`, the object `a` of type `D` is implicitly converted to an `int` using the overloaded `operator int()`.

### 6. **Polymorphism** �
- Although not explicitly used in this code, the concept of [[Polymorphism]] is relevant because `D` inherits from `B`, and `D` objects can be treated as `B` objects.

### 7. **Abstraction** 🎭
- The class `B` hides the implementation details of how `x` is stored and accessed, providing only a public interface (`get_x()` and `operator int()`). This is an example of [[Abstraction]].

## Detailed Breakdown

### Class `B`
- **Data Member**: `int x` (private)
- **Constructor**: `B(int i = 17)` initializes `x` to `i`.
- **Public Methods**:
  - `int get_x()`: Returns the value of `x`.
  - `operator int()`: Converts an object of type `B` to an `int` (returns `x`).

### Class `D`
- **Inheritance**: `D` inherits from `B`.
- **Constructor**: `D(int i = -16)` initializes the base class `B` with the value `i`.

### `main()` Function
- An object `a` of type `D` is created. Since no argument is passed, the default value `-16` is used.
- The expression `27 + a` is evaluated:
  - The object `a` is implicitly converted to an `int` using the overloaded `operator int()` in class `B`.
  - The value of `a` is `-16` (since `D`'s constructor passed `-16` to `B`'s constructor).
  - The result of `27 + (-16)` is `11`, which is printed to the console.

## Simpler Example to Illustrate Operator Overloading

Consider this simpler example to understand [[Operator Overloading]]:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Number {
    int value;
public:
    Number(int v = 0) : value(v) {}
    operator int() { return value; } // Overload int conversion
};

int main() {
    Number n(5);
    int x = n + 10; // n is implicitly converted to int
    cout << x; // Output: 15
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The `Number` class overloads the `int` type conversion operator.
- When `n + 10` is evaluated, `n` is implicitly converted to `5`, and the result is `15`.

## Summary of Concepts Used
- [[Class and Object Concepts]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Constructors]]
- [[Operator Overloading]]
- [[Polymorphism]]
- [[Abstraction]]

This code demonstrates how [[Inheritance]] and [[Operator Overloading]] work together to allow objects to be used in expressions as if they were primitive types. 🚀

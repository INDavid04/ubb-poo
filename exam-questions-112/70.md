# C++ Code Documentation 📄

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class cls1 {
protected:
    int x;

public:
    cls1() { x = 13; }
};

class cls2 : public cls1 {
    int y;

public:
    cls2() { y = 15; }
    int f(cls2 ob) { return (ob.x + ob.y); }
};

int main()
{
    cls2 ob;
    cout << ob.f(ob);
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```

## Explanation of the Code 🧠

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** [[Class and Object concepts]]
   - The code defines two classes: `cls1` and `cls2`.
   - `cls1` is a base class, and `cls2` is a derived class that inherits from `cls1`.
   - An object `ob` of type `cls2` is created in the `main()` function.

### 2. **Inheritance** [[Inheritance]]
   - `cls2` inherits from `cls1` using the `public` access specifier.
   - This means that `cls2` can access the `protected` members of `cls1`, such as `x`.

### 3. **Encapsulation** [[Encapsulation]]
   - The data members `x` (in `cls1`) and `y` (in `cls2`) are encapsulated within their respective classes.
   - `x` is declared as `protected`, so it can be accessed by derived classes like `cls2`.
   - `y` is declared as `private` by default, so it can only be accessed within `cls2`.

### 4. **Constructors** [[Constructors]]
   - Both `cls1` and `cls2` have constructors.
   - The constructor of `cls1` initializes `x` to `13`.
   - The constructor of `cls2` initializes `y` to `15`.

### 5. **Data Members** [[Data Members]]
   - `cls1` has a data member `x`, and `cls2` has a data member `y`.
   - These data members store the values `13` and `15`, respectively.

### 6. **Member Function**
   - `cls2` has a member function `f(cls2 ob)` that takes an object of type `cls2` as a parameter.
   - This function returns the sum of `ob.x` and `ob.y`.

### 7. **Main Function**
   - In the `main()` function, an object `ob` of type `cls2` is created.
   - The function `f(ob)` is called on this object, which calculates and returns the sum of `x` and `y` (i.e., `13 + 15 = 28`).
   - The result is printed to the console.

## Concepts Used in the Code 🛠️

1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**: The code defines classes (`cls1` and `cls2`) and creates an object (`ob`) of type `cls2`.
2. **[[Inheritance]]**: `cls2` inherits from `cls1`, allowing it to access the `protected` member `x`.
3. **[[Encapsulation]]**: Data members `x` and `y` are encapsulated within their respective classes.
4. **[[Constructors]]**: Both classes have constructors that initialize their data members.
5. **[[Data Members]]**: `x` and `y` are data members that store integer values.

## Simpler Example to Illustrate Inheritance 🎯

Here’s a simpler example to illustrate [[Inheritance]]:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Animal is eating!" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog is barking!" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog;
    myDog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
    myDog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Animal is eating!
Dog is barking!
```

In this example:
- The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class.
- The `Dog` object can access the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class, demonstrating [[Inheritance]].

## Key Takeaways 🚀
- The code demonstrates basic [[Class and Object concepts]], [[Inheritance]], and [[Encapsulation]].
- [[Constructors]] are used to initialize data members.
- The `protected` access specifier allows derived classes to access base class members.

This is a simple yet effective example of how [[Inheritance]] and [[Encapsulation]] work together in C++! 🎉

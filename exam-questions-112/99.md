# C++ Code Documentation 📄

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
protected:
    static int x; // Static data member
private:
    int y; // Private data member
public:
    A(int i) { // Constructor
        x = i;
        y = -i + 4;
    }
    int put_x(A a) { // Public member function
        return a.x + a.y;
    }
};

int A::x = 7; // Static member initialization

int main() {
    A a(10); // Object creation
    cout << a.put_x(20); // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```

## Explanation of the Code 🧠

### 1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**
   - The code defines a class `A` with a constructor, a static data member `x`, and a private data member `y`.
   - An object `a` of class `A` is created in the `main()` function using the constructor `A(int i)`.

### 2. **[[Data Members]]**
   - `x` is a **static data member** of class `A`. It is shared across all instances of the class.
   - `y` is a **private data member** of class `A`. It can only be accessed within the class.

### 3. **[[Constructors]]**
   - The constructor `A(int i)` initializes the static member `x` with the value of `i` and the private member `y` with the value `-i + 4`.
   - When `A a(10)` is called, `x` is set to `10` and `y` is set to `-10 + 4 = -6`.

### 4. **Static Member Initialization**
   - The static member `x` is initialized outside the class definition with `int A::x = 7`. However, this value is overwritten when the constructor is called.

### 5. **Member Function**
   - The function `put_x(A a)` takes an object of class `A` as a parameter and returns the sum of `a.x` and `a.y`.
   - In `main()`, `a.put_x(20)` is called. Here, `20` is implicitly converted to an object of class `A` using the constructor `A(int i)`. This sets `x = 20` and `y = -20 + 4 = -16` for the temporary object.
   - The function returns `20 + (-16) = 4`, which is printed.

## Concepts Used in the Code 🔍

1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**: The code defines a class `A` and creates an object `a` of that class.
2. **[[Data Members]]**: The class has a static data member `x` and a private data member `y`.
3. **[[Constructors]]**: The constructor `A(int i)` initializes the data members.
4. **[[Encapsulation]]**: The private data member `y` is encapsulated and cannot be accessed directly outside the class.
5. **[[Static Members]]**: The static member `x` is shared across all instances of the class.

## Simpler Example to Explain Static Members 🎯

Here’s a simpler example to explain **[[Static Members]]**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
public:
    static int count; // Static member
    Counter() { count++; } // Constructor increments count
};

int Counter::count = 0; // Initialize static member

int main() {
    Counter c1, c2, c3; // Create 3 objects
    cout << "Total objects created: " << Counter::count; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Total objects created: 3
```

- The static member `count` is shared across all instances of the class `Counter`.
- Each time an object is created, the constructor increments `count`.

## Key Takeaways 🚀

- **Static members** are shared across all instances of a class.
- **Private members** are encapsulated and cannot be accessed directly outside the class.
- **Constructors** are used to initialize objects.
- The code demonstrates how **[[Class and Object concepts]]**, **[[Data Members]]**, and **[[Encapsulation]]** work together in C++.

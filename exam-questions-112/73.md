## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class B {
public:
	int x;
	B(int i = 16) { x = i; }
	B(){}
	B f(B ob) { return x + ob.x; }
};
class D : public B {
public:
	D(int i = 25) { x = i; }
	B f(B ob) { return x + ob.x + 1; }
	void afisare() { cout << x; }
};
int main()
{
	B *p1 = new D, *p2 = new B, *p3 = new B(p1->f(*p2));
	cout << p3->x;
	return 0;
}
```

## Concepts Used

### [[Class and Object concepts]] üß±
- The code defines two classes: `B` and `D`. 
- `B` is a base class with a data member `x` and a method `f`.
- `D` is a derived class that inherits from `B` and overrides the `f` method.

### [[Inheritance]] üß¨
- Class `D` inherits from class `B`. This means `D` has access to the public and protected members of `B`.
- However, the code has an issue with the constructor of `D` because it doesn't explicitly call a constructor of `B`.

### [[Constructors]] üèóÔ∏è
- The class `B` has two constructors: one with a default parameter and one without any parameters.
- The class `D` has a constructor with a default parameter.
- The error occurs because the compiler cannot decide which constructor of `B` to call when creating an instance of `D`.

### [[Polymorphism]] üé≠
- The method `f` in class `D` overrides the method `f` in class `B`.
- However, due to the way the objects are created and used in `main`, polymorphism isn't effectively utilized here.

### [[Memory Management]] üß†
- The code uses `new` to dynamically allocate memory for objects of type `B` and `D`.
- However, it doesn't use `delete` to free the allocated memory, which could lead to memory leaks.

### [[Encapsulation]] üõ°Ô∏è
- The data member `x` in class `B` is public, which breaks encapsulation. It should ideally be private or protected.

### [[Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) in C++]] üßê
- The code doesn't use RTTI, but it could be useful if we wanted to check the actual type of the object pointed to by `p1` at runtime.

### [[Exception-safe design]] üö®
- The code doesn't handle exceptions, and there's no mechanism to ensure that resources are properly released in case of an error.

## Simplified Example to Illustrate Constructor Ambiguity

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    A() { cout << "Default Constructor\n"; }
    A(int x) { cout << "Parameterized Constructor\n"; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B() { cout << "B's Constructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    B obj;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the compiler will call the default constructor of `A` when creating an object of `B`. If `A` had multiple constructors, the compiler would need to know which one to call, leading to potential ambiguity.

## Conclusion
The code has issues primarily related to [[Constructors]] and [[Inheritance]]. The ambiguity in constructor calls needs to be resolved, and better [[Memory Management]] practices should be followed. Additionally, [[Encapsulation]] should be improved by making data members private or protected.

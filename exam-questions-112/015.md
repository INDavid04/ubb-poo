## Code Explanation 🧠

### 1. **Structure `cls`**
   - The code defines a `struct` named `cls`. In C++, a `struct` is similar to a [[Class and Object concepts|class]], but by default, its members are public.
   - It has one [[Data Members|data member]]: `int x`.
   - It has two member functions:
     - `set_x(int i)`: Sets the value of `x` to `i` and returns the new value of `x`.
     - `get_x()`: Returns the current value of `x`.

### 2. **Main Function**
   - The `main` function dynamically allocates an array of 100 `cls` objects using `new`. This demonstrates [[Memory Management|dynamic memory allocation]] in C++.
   - A loop sets the value of `x` for the first 50 objects in the array using the `set_x` method.
   - Another loop prints the values of `x` for objects indexed from 5 to 19 using the `get_x` method.

### 3. **Output**
   - The output shows the values of `x` for indices 5 to 19, which are `5 6 7 ... 19`. This is because the `set_x` method was called with the loop index, so `x` for each object corresponds to its index.

## Concepts Used 🛠️

1. **[[Class and Object concepts]]**
   - The `struct cls` acts like a class with public members. In C++, `struct` and `class` are almost identical, except for default access specifiers.
   - Objects of `cls` are created dynamically in the `main` function.

2. **[[Encapsulation]]**
   - The `x` member is private by default in a `struct`, but since it’s explicitly declared as `public`, it’s accessible directly. However, the methods `set_x` and `get_x` provide controlled access to `x`.

3. **[[Memory Management]]**
   - The `new` keyword is used to allocate memory for an array of 100 `cls` objects. This demonstrates dynamic memory allocation in C++.

4. **[[Revisiting C language constructs (struct, pointers, arrays) and how they map into C++ classes and methods]]**
   - The code uses a `struct`, which is a C construct, but in C++, it behaves like a class.
   - Pointers (`cls* p`) and arrays (`new cls[100]`) are used, which are common in both C and C++.

## Simpler Example to Explain [[Encapsulation]] 🎯

Here’s a simpler example to illustrate encapsulation:

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance; // Private data member

public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount; // Controlled access
    }

    double getBalance() {
        return balance; // Read-only access
    }
};
```

- The `balance` is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
- The `deposit` and `getBalance` methods provide controlled access to `balance`, ensuring it’s only modified or read in a safe way.

## Key Takeaways 🚀

- The code demonstrates basic [[Class and Object concepts]] and [[Encapsulation]] using a `struct`.
- It uses [[Memory Management]] to dynamically allocate an array of objects.
- The output is generated by iterating over a subset of the array and printing the values stored in the objects.

This is a simple yet effective example of how C++ combines C constructs with object-oriented features! 🎉

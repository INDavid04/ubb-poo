## Code Summary

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** 🧩
- The code defines a class `cls` that represents a dynamic array of integers.
- Objects of this class (`x`, `y`, and `z`) are created in the `main()` function.

### 2. **Encapsulation** 🔒
- The class `cls` encapsulates its data members (`v` and `nr`) by making them private. This ensures that they can only be accessed or modified through public methods.

### 3. **Constructors** 🏗️
- The class has a constructor that initializes the object. It takes an integer `i` as a parameter (defaulting to 0) and allocates memory for an array of size `i`. It also initializes the array elements to multiples of 3.

### 4. **Destructors** 🗑️
- The destructor `~cls()` is defined to release the dynamically allocated memory for the array `v` when the object goes out of scope. This is crucial for preventing memory leaks.

### 5. **Operator Overloading** ⚙️
- The `operator+` function is overloaded to allow adding two `cls` objects. It creates a new `cls` object and initializes its array elements to the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input objects.

### 6. **Memory Management** 🧠
- The class uses dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete[]`) to manage the array `v`. This is a key aspect of [[Memory Management]] in C++.

### 7. **Data Members** 📊
- The class has two data members:
  - `int *v`: A pointer to a dynamically allocated array.
  - `int nr`: The size of the array.

### 8. **Operator Overloading Example** 🎯
- The `operator[]` is overloaded to provide array-like access to the elements of `v`. For example, `x[3]` accesses the 4th element of the array in object `x`.

## Concepts Used

### 1. **Class and Object Concepts** 🧩
- The class `cls` is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects (`x`, `y`, and `z`) are instances of this class.

### 2. **Encapsulation** 🔒
- The private data members (`v` and `nr`) are hidden from external access, ensuring controlled access through public methods.

### 3. **Constructors** 🏗️
- The constructor initializes the object and allocates memory for the array.

### 4. **Destructors** 🗑️
- The destructor ensures that dynamically allocated memory is properly released.

### 5. **Operator Overloading** ⚙️
- The `operator+` and `operator[]` are overloaded to provide intuitive operations on `cls` objects.

### 6. **Memory Management** �🧠
- The use of `new` and `delete[]` demonstrates manual memory management in C++.

## Simpler Example: Operator Overloading

Here’s a simpler example to illustrate [[Operator Overloading]]:

```cpp
class Point {
    int x, y;
public:
    Point(int a = 0, int b = 0) : x(a), y(b) {}
    Point operator+(const Point& p) {
        return Point(x + p.x, y + p.y);
    }
    void print() { cout << "(" << x << ", " << y << ")\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Point p1(1, 2), p2(3, 4);
    Point p3 = p1 + p2; // Uses overloaded + operator
    p3.print(); // Output: (4, 6)
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Takeaways 🚀
- The code demonstrates [[Class and Object Concepts]], [[Encapsulation]], [[Constructors]], [[Destructors]], [[Operator Overloading]], and [[Memory Management]].
- The output is a result of adding two `cls` objects (`x` and `y`) and printing the resulting array. The seemingly random numbers in the output are due to the way the array elements are initialized and modified.
